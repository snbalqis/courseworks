This is a coursework project for the module 'ST2195 Programming for Data Science'.

The aim is to answer the following questions using R and Python:
1. When is the best time of day, day of the week, and time of year to fly to minimise delays?
2. Do older planes suffer more delays?
3. How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time?
4. Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others?
5. Use the available variables to construct a model that predicts delays.

The dataset chosen are of the years 2000 to 2004 from
'The 2009 ASA Statistical Computing and Graphics Data Expo consisted of flight arrival and departure details for all commercial flights on major carriers within the USA, from October 1987 to April 2008.'.
